# Security Checklist for Render Deployment

## ‚úÖ Completed Security Fixes

1. **Created `.gitignore`** - Prevents sensitive files from being committed
   - `.env` file is now ignored
   - `venv/` directory is ignored
   - Database files are ignored

2. **Removed hardcoded credentials from `app/database.py`**
   - Removed hardcoded Neon database credentials
   - Now requires all credentials to be set via environment variables
   - Added validation to ensure required env vars are present

3. **Verified `.env` is gitignored** - Confirmed with `git check-ignore`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Render Configuration

When deploying to Render, you MUST set these environment variables in Render's dashboard:

### For Neon Database (Production):
```
USE_NEON=true
NEON_USER=<your-neon-username>
NEON_PASSWORD=<your-neon-password>
NEON_HOST=<your-neon-host>
NEON_PORT=5432
NEON_DATABASE_NAME=<your-database-name>
```

### For Local PostgreSQL (Development):
```
USE_NEON=false
DB_USER=<your-local-db-user>
DB_PASSWORD=<your-local-db-password>
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=<your-local-db-name>
```

## üìã Pre-Push Checklist

Before pushing to GitHub:
- [x] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [x] No hardcoded credentials in source code
- [x] `venv/` is excluded
- [x] Database files are excluded
- [ ] Remove or sanitize `env_example.txt` if it contains real credentials

## üîí Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` files** - They contain sensitive credentials
2. **Use environment variables** - Set them in Render dashboard, not in code
3. **Keep `env_example.txt` generic** - It should only show structure, not real values
4. **Rotate credentials** - If any credentials were exposed, rotate them immediately
5. **Use Render's PostgreSQL** - Consider using Render's managed PostgreSQL instead of Neon for simpler configuration

## üìù Note About env_example.txt

The `env_example.txt` file currently contains actual Neon credentials. You should:
1. Either delete this file, or
2. Replace all values with placeholders like:
   ```
   NEON_USER=your_username_here
   NEON_PASSWORD=your_password_here
   NEON_HOST=your_host_here
   ```

## ‚úÖ Safe to Push

After addressing the above, your code is safe to push to GitHub and deploy to Render.
